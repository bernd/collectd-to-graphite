Graphite is great.

Collectd has piles of plugins.

Let's glue them together.

In collectd.conf, put this:

<Plugin write_http>
  <URL "http://monitor:3012/post-collectd">
    Format "JSON"
  </URL>
</Plugin>

Then run this little javascript bit in node. It will take data from collectd
and ship it to graphite.

This is a work in progress. It also may not stay in node/javascript since I
am not really sold on the platform.

Future?
- Support the binary protocol collectd uses for the network plugin.
- Use node-ffi to call collectd plugins (as collectd would) and ship out
  graphite (or any other protocol!)
- Implement as collectd plugin? The collectd plugin docs basically "do not use
  this api" and also requires GPL2, so maybe this route isn't the right one.
